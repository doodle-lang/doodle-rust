//! The resolver (M1.10): one pass over the parsed [`Ast`] producing an immutable
//! [`ResolvedModule`] — the environment model the M2 machine consumes.
//!
//! This is the M1.10**a** slice: name resolution only. It builds the scope/frame
//! model (machine-design §7), assigns local **slots**, classifies every name
//! reference as a local slot, a block **static link**, a closure **capture**, or
//! a free **module name** (`name_refs`, AD5), and records module-level
//! declarations (`globals`). The static-error battery (M1.10b), the Void /
//! fn-falls-off-end checks (M1.10c, S-5/S-6), and tail marking (M1.11) layer on
//! top later — the [`CallableInfo`] fields they populate arrive with them.
//!
//! Design: `discussions/plan/resolver-m1.10-design.md` (and machine-design
//! §2/§6/§7). Two axes are kept distinct (conflating them is the classic
//! resolver bug): **lexical scope** (name visibility — every construct body is
//! its own scope, L§5.4) and **frame** (slot storage — only callable and block
//! bodies open a frame; a construct body runs in the enclosing frame).
